# Study of the combined effect of maternal tobacco smoking and polygenic risk scores on birth weight and body mass index in childhood 

The next repository contains the commands to calculate polygenic risk scores, an estimate of an individual’s genetic liability to a trait or disease, calculated according to their genotype profile and relevant genome-wide association study (GWAS) data), enabling person’s individual risk of developing a particular disease. 
Hence, PRSs for 4 common traits in the Human Early Life Exposome *(HELIX)* project are included in the analyses. The *HELIX* project contains data from 1.304 children aged between six and eleven years old, coming from six on-going European cohorts. Once the PRS were calculated, one tested the effect modification of each PRS on the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and each common trait to define: (1) how maternal smoking during pregnancy modifies the mentioned phenotypes, and (2) its combined effect. 

## Preamble

*1.* A file whose contains the commands needed for preparing the base data is included.

*2.* A script is uploaded for preparing the phenotypic data in three main groups of traits. 

*3.* Files including the code for computing the polygenic risk scores in all the traits one tested for the presented study. 

*4.* Script containing the code for a descriptive analysis.

*5.* Codes to represent scaled boxplots for all the phenotypes tested. 

*6.* A file that summarises results and creates matrices is incorporated as well. 

*8.* The script for the statistical analyses (linear regresion models) is also included. 

*9.* The code to perform the interaction plots are enclosed as well. 

*10.* A file that includes the script to test for global interaction.
