# Study of the combined effect of maternal tobacco smoking and polygenic risk scores on birth weight and body mass index in childhood

The repository contains the commands to study the combined effect of maternal tobacco smoking and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) on birth weight (BW) and body mass index (BMI) related traits in childhood in the  Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) project. The HELIX project contains data from 1,304 children aged between six and eleven years old, from six on-going European cohorts. A PRS is an estimate of an individualâ€™s genetic liability to a trait or disease, calculated according to their genotype profile and relevant genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. In this study we calculated PRS for 4 different traits and tested their association with maternal smoking in relation to the phenotypic traits. 

## Preamble

*1.* Code to prepare base GWAS data.

*2.* Script to prepare phenotypic data in three main groups of traits.

*3-6.* Files to compute the PRS for BW and BMI related traits and testing their associations with the phenotypic traits using PRSice v2.

*7.* Code for a descriptive analysis.

*8.* Codes to represent scaled boxplots for all the phenotypes tested.

*9.* A file that summarises results and creates matrices is incorporated as well.

*10.* The script for the statistical analyses (linear regresion models) is also included.

*11.* The code to perform the interaction plots are enclosed as well.

*12.* A file that includes the script to test for global interaction.
